## 📁 Projects Included

### 🔐 1. Caesar Cipher
A classic encryption technique that shifts characters by a fixed key value.

- Supports encryption & decryption
- Handles alphabets and punctuation
- CLI-based user interaction

---

### 🔐 2. Vigenère Cipher
An extension of Caesar cipher that uses a keyword for polyalphabetic encryption.

- Encrypt & decrypt text using a key
- Preserves letter casing
- Useful introduction to cryptography concepts

---

### 💳 3. Luhn Algorithm (Card Validator)
Implementation of the Luhn checksum algorithm used in credit/debit card validation.

- Validates numeric input sequences
- Explains each processing step in comments
- Demonstrates algorithmic thinking

---

### ➗ 4. Bisection Method (Root Finding)
Numerical method to find roots of equations within a given interval.

- Works on continuous mathematical functions
